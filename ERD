Our ERD diagram shows four tables: Users, Transactions, Transaction_categories and System logs. 
The Users table helps us track the users information like their name and phone numbers.
The Transaction table helps us record all the transactions regardless of any order or category. The Transaction table is the main table as its Primary Key is a Foreign Key to all the other tables
The Transaction_categories table helps us categorize the transactions as it is the whole point of the system. The transactions can either be about sending or receiving 
Finally the System_logs table helps us keep track of all times the user interacts with the system
The relationship of Users to Transactions is 1:M because one user can have an infinite number of transactions.
The relationship of Transaction to Transaction_categories is 1:1 because a transaction can be one and only one category
The relationship between System_logs and Transaction is 1:1 because everytime a user interacts with the system they do one transaction.
